On Ubuntu, java path and javaws path are two different things. You could do:

java -version

get one version, yet javaws could run on another. If have more than one JVM 
install on the dev machine, always check the following:

sudo update-alternatives --config java
sudo update-alternatives --config javaws

The thing is, that IcedTea implementation works a lot different than Oracle's. 
Specifically, the DownloadServiceListener (custom downloader / progress) is 
not supported by IcedTea - instead, splash is displayed with a built in 
shitty progress.
