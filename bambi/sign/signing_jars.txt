# This is just a helper file with some additional information needed to sign 
# Bambi JARs for Web Start deployment. Until somone contributes certificate 
# with a validated chain, we will be dealing with a locally generated self  
# signed one. Our certificate is generated to be valid for 1 year, therefore 
# when it expires it needs to be re-generated:
#
# ONE TIME: generate keystore (cert):
keytool -genkey -keyalg RSA -alias selfsigned -keystore keystore.jks -storepass password -validity 360 -keysize 2048
#
# /bambi-editor and /bambi-webstart JARs are automatically signed by their 
# respective Maven builds.
#
# to verify jar signatures after build
jarsigner -verify -certs -verbose bambi-webstart-XXX.jar
jarsigner -verify -certs -verbose bambi-editor-XXX.jar
#
# When testing Web Start deployment it often helps to know how to clear JWS 
# cache:
javaws -uninstall
