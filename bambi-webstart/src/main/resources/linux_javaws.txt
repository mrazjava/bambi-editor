On Ubuntu (and I'd imagine other distros as well), java path and javaws path 
are two different things. You could do:

java -version

get one version, yet:

javaws -version

could show another. If have more than one JVM installed on your dev machine, 
always check the following (debian syntax):

sudo update-alternatives --config java
sudo update-alternatives --config javaws

The thing is, that IcedTea implementation works a lot different than Oracle's. 
Specifically, the DownloadServiceListener (custom downloader / progress) is 
not supported by IcedTea - instead, splash is displayed with a built in 
shitty progress.
