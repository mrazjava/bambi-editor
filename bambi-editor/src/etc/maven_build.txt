BambiEditor can be built in two modes: DESKTOP and WEBSTART. Each build type 
results in different outputs. For DESKTOP we build a small executable JAR with 
several dependencies (referenced in the MANIFEST) and packaged in lib/. The 
desktop build scheme is very much a typical software packaging scheme. Rather 
than releasing a huge set of dependencies with every minor release, we only 
want to release dependencies when they change (though there is nothing that 
precludes us from packaging dependencies with every release).

For WEBSTART we always package executable code together with dependencies into 
a single huge JAR. This makes setting up JNLP much more straightfoward.

The pom.xml is configured for above two build schemes with profile ids:

app ........ desktop version
ws  ........ webstart version

cd target

mvn clean package -P app
mvn clean package -P ws
