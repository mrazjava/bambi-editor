	<h1>Welcome to Bambi Editor!</h1>
BambiEditor is an easy to use desktop image authoring tool capable of fast 
and quick filter transformations and no-nonse printing. BambiEditor is also a 
web authoring tool for web developers which allows their end users to upload 
images scaled exactly to specific web requirements. Simply deploy Bambi as 
Java Web Start, replace the default FilesystemImageExporter plugin with one 
of web upload plugins and you're good to go! BTW.. you can write your own 
plugin too, like a Facebook or Twitter upload plugin. We love contributions :-)
<p>
BambiEditor is <b>free</b> software, released under GPL. This, as all 0.9x  
versions is a BETA as we march towards a feature complete 1.0.
